The violin transcription model and the dataset accompanying the paper: 
```
N. C. Tamer, Y. Ozer, M. Muller, X. Serra, "High-Resolution Violin Transcription using Weak Labels", in Proc. ISMIR, 2023
```

The dataset can be found under the **dataset** folder and is comprised of three violin etude books played by 22 violinists. 
We share the open-source MIDI files aligned with the performance links. 
The filenames are structured with links to the performances: 
```
{composer}_{catalog_number}_{performer}_{YouTube_ID}-{YouTube_start_sec}-{YouTube_end_sec}.mid
```

The model architecture can be found under the **musc** folder.
